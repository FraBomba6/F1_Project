## So, what is this?
I developed this project because I'm a big fan of F1. You know... Italia, Pasta, Pizza, [Ferrari](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Egg-nCSVkAAOx5-?format=jpg&name=small) and so on.

Getting serious now. My objective was to show some intresting data to my colleagues and stimulate their curiosity.

### Project sections
This project can be splitted in three sections:
1. #### Introduction on F1, the current season and F1 geography:
    In this section there's an introduction to F1, an introduction to the current season and some data elaboration to visualize the GPs distribution around the globe in all the F1 history, to show how much Italy is bounded to this sport
2. #### Performance progression in the last 20-ish years:
    When we normally think to technical development we expect a corresponding performance improvment. Is this always true? In the second section I give a response to this question
3. #### Ranking:
    If you ask somebody "Who is the best pilot ever?" to a group of F1 fans you must be prepared to an heated discussion. Every fan has his personal parameters to judge a pilot
